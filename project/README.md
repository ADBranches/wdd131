# RealityMix AR

RealityMix is an immersive augmented reality (AR) web application built using AR.js, A-Frame, Three.js, and Vite.  
This project demonstrates marker-based AR experiences leveraging modern web technologies and 3D asset loading.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

---

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if not done already)

    ```
    git clone 
    cd realitymix
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

---

### Development

Navigate to the project root directory and start the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

- This will launch a local development server at `http://localhost:5173`.
- The app supports hot module reloading for rapid development.
- Make sure your device’s webcam is connected and accessible in the browser for AR functionality.

---

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Start development server with hot reload.
- `npm run build` — Build production optimized assets.
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build locally.
- `npm run validate:models` — Validate your GLB/GLTF 3D model files for correctness.
- `npm run perf:check` — Run a simple performance tick check script.

---

### Project Structure Overview

- `public/` — Static assets served directly, including GLB models and camera parameters.
- `src/js/ar/` — Core AR scene setup, loader, and marker tracking scripts.
- `src/js/ui/` — UI components and controls.
- `src/js/utils/` — Utility modules.
- `scripts/` — Validation utilities for 3D models.

---

### Notes

- Models are preloaded using A-Frame `` to ensure smooth scene initialization.
- Uses AR.js 3.x scoped npm package (`@ar-js-org/ar.js`) with A-Frame 1.7 and Three.js 0.179.1.
- Ensure your 3D model assets are placed in `public/assets/models/` and you reference them by correct IDs in configs.

---

### Troubleshooting

- If you see a `Scene load timeout` error, verify that your 3D models and camera parameter files exist and are accessible.
- Use `npm run validate:models` to check if your GLB files are valid.
- For favicon 404 warnings, add a `favicon.ico` in the `public` folder or ignore if not important.
